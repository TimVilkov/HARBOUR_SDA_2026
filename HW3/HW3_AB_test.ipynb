    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "You are a data analyst on a mobile game team. The team launched a change in onboarding / paywall / checkout and asks you to evaluate impact using **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this homework, ARPU is computed at the **user level over the whole period**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First aggregate revenue per user over the period:\n",
    "$Revenue_u = \\sum_{d \\in period} revenue_{u,d}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Then compute ARPU as the mean across users:\n",
    "$ARPU = \\dfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{u=1}^{N} Revenue_u$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why ARPU is commonly used:\n",
    "- In A/B tests with equal-sized groups, $\\Delta ARPU$ is directly proportional to the difference in **total revenue** between groups:\n",
    "  $TotalRevenue = N \\cdot ARPU$\n",
    "  so comparing ARPU is equivalent to comparing total revenue (up to a constant factor).\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue data is usually tricky:\n",
    "- many users have **zero revenue**\n",
    "- heavy tails (rare users with very large payments)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of that, we want to be careful with “standard” asymptotic tests.\n",

    "You have two files:\n",
